    <h1>Hatch End Harrow Triathlon</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.jetstreamtri.com">Jetstream</a> Hatch End - Harrow Triathlon is a popular
        family-oriented race targeted at inexperienced/less-confident triathletes and non-triathletes wanting a new
        challenge.
        The pool based swim and less competitive, family-oriented nature makes this an ideal starter race for
        those new to the sport.<br />
        Experienced triathletes are also welcome to enter, however early entry is advised as places are limited
        to ensure sufficient space for novices and less-experienced triathletes.
    </p>
    <p>The Adult race features a 400m pool swim, 17km road cycle and 3km off-road run.
        Junior races are for ages 8-16, with an off road cycle and British Triathlon approved age appropriate distances.
