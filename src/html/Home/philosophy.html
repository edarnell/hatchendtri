    <strong>Philosophy</strong>
    <br />
    We may each be insignificant droplets but together we make the tide of humanity.
    Earth's position in the {links.milky_way} means humanity has the potential to survive for over
    three billion years, that is more than 100 million generations into the future.
    We have only taken the first few steps of this journey and are currently headed in
    the wrong direction. Civilization is required for success.
    There is no place for ignorance and greed in a civilised society. As we migrate
    towards civilisation we should recognise that those who have escaped the bonds of
    {links.wage_slavery} are not all the same. Those who use their unequal wealth to
    promote equality should not be confused with those who use it to sow the seeds of
    division and hatred. We must not return to the rhetoric of 1930s Germany. In the UK,
    football might be our salvation. It is a game which unites despite the
    light-hearted tribal warfare. As with all sport it is played by people who know
    how to work hard whilst helping others. Yes, the pay at the top level is
    silly but football is not unique in this. Footballers, please continue to {links.speak_truth_to_power},
    and the {links.champions_league} may still be running in 3,000,002,023 {links.ce} (although hopefully
    you may help us transition form CE="Common Era" to CE="Civilised Era").
