    This new model of hydrogen was invented by an individual,
    but is the result of many years of study and discussion with others.
    The model could not have been created without the assistance of {links.AI} in the form
    of {links.chatgpt} and {links.copilot}. If you would like to
    join the search for answers, then please look me up on {links.github} or {links.researchgate}.
    If you are a friend, then please help me test this site by linking to me. If you are neither then that is
    fine too, and you are most welcome to use this site to connect with those who form part of your journey.
