    <strong>The Science</strong>
    <br />
    {links.quantum_mechanics} and {links.general_relativity}, are the two pillars of modern physics.
    Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy on a small scale
    (such as atoms and subatomic particles), while general relativity
    describes the behavior of matter and energy on a large scale (such as
    planets and galaxies). By bringing these two frameworks together, we
    can develop a more complete understanding of the universe and how it
    works. This <i>curious mind</i> model of the atom, is based on the compression and curvature of space,
    and provides a new perspective on
    the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. By combining the frameworks we
    remove the plethora of forces and
    strange particle behaviours, and can instead use more natural and
    intuitive scientific explanations.
