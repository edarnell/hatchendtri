            The {links.jetstream} Hatch End – Harrow Triathlon is a popular family-oriented
            race targeted at inexperienced/less-confident triathletes and non-triathletes wanting a new challenge.
            The pool based swim and less competitive, family-oriented nature makes this an ideal starter race for
