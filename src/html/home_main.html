    The {links.Jetstream} Hatch End â€“ Harrow Triathlon is a popular family-oriented
    race targeted at inexperienced/less-confident triathletes and non-triathletes wanting a new challenge.
    The pool based swim and less competitive, family-oriented nature makes this an ideal starter race for
    those new to the sport.
